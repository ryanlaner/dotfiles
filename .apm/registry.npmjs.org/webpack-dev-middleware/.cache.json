webpack-dev-middleware\r\n\r\n**THIS MIDDLEWARE SHOULD ONLY USED FOR DEVELOPMENT!**\r\n\r\n**DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!**\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\n\r\nIt's a simple wrapper middleware for webpack. It serves the files emitted from webpack over a connect server.\r\n\r\nIt has a few advantages over bundling it as files:\r\n\r\n* No files are written to disk, it handle the files in memory\r\n* If files changed in watch mode, the middleware no longer serves the old bundle, but delays requests until the compiling has finished. You don't have to wait before refreshing the page after a file modification.\r\n* I may add some specifiy optimation in future releases.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar webpackMiddleware = require(\"webpack-dev-middleware\");\r\napp.use(webpackMiddleware(...));\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\napp.use(webpackMiddleware(webpack({\r\n\t// webpack options\r\n\t// webpackMiddleware takes a Compiler object as first parameter\r\n\t// which is returned by webpack(...) without callback.\r\n\tentry: \"...\",\r\n\toutput: {\r\n\t\tpath: \"/\"\r\n\t\t// no real path is required, just pass \"/\"\r\n\t\t// but it will work with other paths too.\r\n\t}\r\n}), {\r\n\t// all options optional\r\n\r\n\tnoInfo: false,\r\n\t// display no info to console (only warnings and errors)\r\n\r\n\tquiet: false,\r\n\t// display nothing to the console\r\n\r\n\tlazy: true,\r\n\t// switch into lazy mode\r\n\t// that means no watching, but recompilation on every request\r\n\r\n\twatchDelay: 300,\r\n\t// delay after change (only lazy: false)\r\n\r\n\tpublicPath: \"/assets/\",\r\n\t// public path to bind the middleware to\r\n\t// use the same as in webpack\r\n\r\n\theaders: { \"X-Custom-Header\": \"yes\" },\r\n\t// custom headers\r\n\r\n\tstats: {\r\n\t\tcolors: true\r\n\t}\r\n\t// options for formating the statistics\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-08-19T08:45:09.065Z","created":"2012-08-08T20:19:25.926Z","0.5.0":"2012-08-08T20:19:28.843Z","0.5.1":"2012-08-08T20:24:13.309Z","0.6.0":"2012-09-11T15:16:42.427Z","0.6.1":"2012-09-11T15:37:39.383Z","0.6.2":"2012-09-19T11:49:28.762Z","0.7.0":"2012-09-25T18:56:04.436Z","0.7.1":"2012-10-08T12:46:29.221Z","0.7.2":"2012-11-08T14:58:34.090Z","0.7.3":"2012-11-08T15:07:59.949Z","0.7.4":"2012-11-09T07:04:07.287Z","0.8.0":"2012-11-09T07:27:01.013Z","0.8.1":"2012-11-20T18:07:33.676Z","0.8.2":"2013-01-24T13:23:17.516Z","0.9.0":"2013-02-04T08:57:58.764Z","0.9.1":"2013-02-04T09:17:21.792Z","0.10.0":"2013-03-26T17:25:30.817Z","0.10.1":"2013-03-26T19:07:14.786Z","0.10.2":"2013-05-12T21:27:19.172Z","0.11.0":"2013-06-19T12:11:47.892Z","1.0.0":"2013-12-17T22:47:30.889Z","1.0.1":"2014-01-05T00:08:11.837Z","1.0.2":"2014-01-22T15:40:36.556Z","1.0.3":"2014-01-22T22:29:55.753Z","1.0.4":"2014-01-27T21:44:29.407Z","1.0.5":"2014-03-12T10:35:51.185Z","1.0.6":"2014-05-22T10:17:44.963Z","1.0.7":"2014-06-04T06:39:46.924Z","1.0.8":"2014-06-06T20:57:27.585Z","1.0.9":"2014-06-18T21:08:57.788Z","1.0.10":"2014-07-02T20:26:00.411Z","1.0.11":"2014-08-19T08:45:09.065Z"},"author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"http://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware","users":{},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/issues"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"RBOA51D2KUM7GEI8UJYYAQ2N\""}
