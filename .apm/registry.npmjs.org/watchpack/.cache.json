watchpack\r\n\r\nWrapper library for directory and file watching.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webpack/watchpack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webpack/watchpack) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/e5u2qvmugtv0r647/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sokra/watchpack/branch/master)\r\n\r\n## Concept\r\n\r\nwatchpack high level API don't map directly to watchers. Instead a three level architecture ensures that for each directory only a single watcher exists.\r\n\r\n* The high level API requests `DirectoryWatchers` from a `WatcherManager`, which ensures that only a single `DirectoryWatcher` per directory is created.\r\n* A user-faced `Watcher` can be obtained from a `DirectoryWatcher` and provides a filtered view on the `DirectoryWatcher`.\r\n* Reference-counting is used on the `DirectoryWatcher` and `Watcher` to decide when to close them.\r\n* The real watchers (currently chokidar) are created by the `DirectoryWatcher`.\r\n* Files are never watched directly. This should keep the watcher count low.\r\n* Watching can be started in the past. This way watching can start after file reading.\r\n* Symlinks are not followed, instead the symlink is watched.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar Watchpack = require(\"watchpack\");\r\n\r\nvar wp = new Watchpack({\r\n\t// options:\r\n\taggregateTimeout: 1000\r\n\t// fire \"aggregated\" event when after a change for 1000ms no additonal change occured\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Watchpack.prototype.watch(string[] files, string[] directories, [number startTime])\r\nwp.watch(listOfFiles, listOfDirectories, Date.now() - 10000);\r\n// starts watching these files and directories\r\n// calling this again will override the files and directories\r\n\r\nwp.on(\"change\", function(filePath, mtime) {\r\n\t// filePath: the changed file\r\n\t// mtime: last modified time for the changed file\r\n});\r\n\r\nwp.on(\"aggregated\", function(changes) {\r\n\t// changes: an array of all changed files\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Watchpack.prototype.pause()\r\nwp.pause();\r\n// stops emitting events, but keeps watchers open\r\n\r\n// Watchpack.prototype.close()\r\nwp.close();\r\n// stops emitting events and closes all watchers\r\n\r\n// Watchpack.prototype.getTimes()\r\nvar fileTimes = wp.getTimes();\r\n// returns an object with all know change times for files\r\n// this include timestamps from files not directly watched\r\n// key: absolute path, value: timestamp as number\r\n```\r\n\r\n","maintainers":[{"name":"sokra","email":"tobias.koppers@googlemail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-01-24T09:50:39.292Z","created":"2014-10-09T06:48:51.514Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-09T06:48:51.514Z","0.1.1":"2014-11-02T22:53:10.008Z","0.1.2":"2014-11-11T23:07:10.341Z","0.1.3":"2014-11-18T22:53:53.283Z","0.2.0":"2015-01-17T18:12:02.174Z","0.2.1":"2015-01-17T20:50:59.908Z","0.2.2":"2015-01-20T22:45:35.020Z","0.2.3":"2015-01-24T09:50:39.292Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/webpack/watchpack","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/webpack/watchpack.git"},"author":{"name":"Tobias Koppers @sokra"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","description":"Wrapper library for directory and file watching.","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"55SXRP7JJMFY4HHQ24ZKGSYCP\""}
