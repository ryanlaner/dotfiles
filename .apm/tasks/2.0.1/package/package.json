Allows you to easily add, complete, and archive your tasks.\n\nAdjust the settings to match your ideal style. Change all the markers to '-' to match taskpaper.\n\nAny line that ends with `:` will be considered a header (like `My Things:`)\n\nAdd tags to tasks by starting them with an `@`, such as `@important` or setting a value like `@due(tuesday)`.\n\nThis uses utf characters, so it is still valid as a plain text document.\n\nYou can also set a custom date/time format in the settings. These can be converted in an existing document using the Tasks: Update Timestamp Format.\n\nBased off the awesome sublime text plugin https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks\n\n## Hotkeys\n\n### Mac\n* **cmd-enter:** add a new todo item below the current\n* **cmd-shift-enter:** add a new todo item above the current\n* **cmd-d:** toggle completion of the task\n* **cmd-shift-a:** move all completed tasks to the archive section\n* **ctrl-c:** cancel the selected tasks\n\n### PC, Linux\n* **ctrl-enter:** add a new todo item below the current\n* **ctrl-shift-enter:** add a new todo item above the current\n* **ctrl-d:** toggle completion of the task\n* **ctrl-shift-a:** move all completed tasks to the archive section\n* **alt-c:** cancel the selected tasks\n\n### Other Methods\n* **Convert to Task:** Converts a non-task line to a task\n* **Update Timestamps:** Attempt to convert cancelled and done tag timestamps to match the settings format\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/irrationalistic/atom-tasks/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/irrationalistic/atom-tasks","_id":"tasks@2.0.1","_shasum":"d97b919922e26c9d7d3f20f4e10b8ef88c415761","_resolved":"file:../d-115419-64439-98f41b/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115419-64439-98f41b/package.tgz"}
