I'm offering it as a starting point for interested people to test out and see the general direction that Markdown editing in FoldingText for Atom will take.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis package contains:\n\n- Commands to copy an outline as Markdown and paste Markdown as an outline.\n\n- Commands for setting Markdown `data-type`s on items. CommonMark AST type names are used for `data-type` values. Example types include `Header`, `CodeBlock`, `Ordered`, etc.\n\n- Style rules making those types visible in the outline editor.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/FoldingText/foldingtext-markdown/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/FoldingText/foldingtext-markdown","_id":"foldingtext-markdown@1.3.2","_shasum":"25a5e851e377ca2de8ce661b941eb0ff4c615c09","_resolved":"file:../d-115516-90221-11lfe8f/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115516-90221-11lfe8f/package.tgz"}
